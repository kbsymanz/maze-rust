# Maze-Rust

A maze generation program written in Rust.

## Features

- Generates mazes in PNG and/or JSON format.
- Saves to files with unique UUID file names.
- Batch mode allows generating many mazes at once.
- Specify the size of the maze to generate.
- Uses the recursive backtracker algorithm.


## Credits

- A thank you to Tomas Korcak and his [Maze](https://github.com/korczis/maze-rs)
project for some of the ideas that found their way into this project. As my
first Rust project, I gained a lot by looking at Tomas' code.
- Another thank you to Jamis Buck and his book, "Mazes for Programmers: Code
Your Own Twisty Lttle Passages", for the recursive backtracker algorithm.
